# HTTP Requests and Login written in Golang

## - Project based learning of the golang language. -


### In this project I will build:
> an API which can make requests to a remote server, 
> get the response in form of a JSON and process that JSON in some fashion. 

### Also, I will implement some form of authentication logic in the code to familiarize myself with the concept.

### Finally, I'll shift from a pre-made server script and build my own one, such that at the end I would have passed through both the client and the server side code logic. 

##### If you've got any suggestions please leave me a message on any of my socials! 

## Thank you for visiting this page!
