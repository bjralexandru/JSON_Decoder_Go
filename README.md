# HTTP Requests and Token-Based-Requests written in Golang

Project based learning of the Golang (Go) programming language. 


#### In this project I will build:
* an API which can make requests to a remote server, 
* get the response in form of a JSON and process that JSON in some fashion. 

#### Also, I will implement some form of authentication logic in the code to familiarize myself with the concept.
